# Welcome to EDUVRWorldBuilders 
Testing out the world builder setup
## Getting Started
1) Read this document on world building standards (need link)
2) Create an entry on this spreadsheet (need link)
## Finished with your world?
1) log into the shared altvr account and create a template (keep in mind the naming convention)
2) upload the Zip file of your template (Note: we can have them upload via Unity, but there is a higher risk of someone accidentally clicking on the wrong template and overriding other template)
3) Update your entry's status in the spreadsheet. 
4) Notify others in the discord channel to test out the world
