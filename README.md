# Welcome to EDUVRWorldBuilders 
Testing out the world builder setup
## Getting Started
1) Read this document on world building standards (need link)
## Finished with your world?
1) log into the shared altvr account and create a template (keep in mind the naming convention)
2) upload the Zip file of your template (Note: we can have them upload via Unity, but there is a higher risk of someone accidentally clicking on the wrong template and overriding an other template)
3) Fill in the information on this spreadsheet (need link)
